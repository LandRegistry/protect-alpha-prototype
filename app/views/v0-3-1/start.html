      <p>HM Land Registry keeps a record of everyone who owns a property (and their land). This record (your title deed) proves that you are the owner.</p>

      <p>If you own a house, flat or any other type of property, HM Land Registry has a record of your:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>name</li>
        <li>address (the one you own)
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        About this service
      </h2>

      <p>If there is a problem with your property, for example fraud, HM Land Registry will send a letter to the address you own.</p>

      <p>If you donâ€™t live at this address, you can ask us to send a:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>letter to a different property</li>
        <li>text</li>

        How the service works
      </h2>

      <p>Check the contact details on your title deed. These should be the quickest way to contact you.</p>

      <p>HM Land Registry recommends that you add an email or phone number. These are the quickest way to contact you if there is a problem with your property.</p>
      
      <p>You will:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>search for your property (by postcode or title number)</li>
        <li>confirm your address (or addresses, if you own more than 1 property)</li>
        <li>check your contact details</li>
        <li>update these details, if there is a quicker way for HM Land Registry to contact you</li>
      </ul>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>email</li>
        <li>phone number</li>
        <li>postal address (this can be different to the property you own)</li>
