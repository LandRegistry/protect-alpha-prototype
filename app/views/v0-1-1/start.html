      <p>HM Land Registry can warn you by text, email or letter if we suspect property fraud on your home.</p>

      <p>HM Land Registry keeps a record of everyone who owns a property (and their land). This record (your title deed) proves that you own your land.</p>

      <p>If you own a house, flat or any other type of property, HM Land Registry has a record of your:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>name</li>
        <li>address (the one you own)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        About this service
      </h2>

      <p>If there is a problem with your property, for example fraud, HM Land Registry will send a letter to the address you own.</p>

      <p>If you donâ€™t live at this address, you can ask us to send a:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>letter to a deifferent property</li>
        <li>text</li>
        <li>email</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        How it works
      </h2>

      <p>You will search for the property you own (by postcode). We will show you the contact details we have for this property.</p>
      
      <p>These contact details should be the quickest way to contact you. You can add or change your:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>email</li>
        <li>phone number</li>
        <li>home address (if you live in a different property)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          Adding your home address <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">will not change your registered title address</span> (the address for the property you own).
      </div>

      <p>HM Land Registry recommends that you add an email or phone number. These are the quickest way to contact you if there is a problem with your property.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Identification documents you will need
      </h2>

      <p>Want to check and confirm your contact details on your property record? You will need to prove your identity as the property owner.</p>

      <p>You will need 3 of the following documents to prove your identity as the property owner:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Passport</li>
        <li>Driving license</li>
