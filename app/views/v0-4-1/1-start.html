      <p>HM Land Registry can warn you by letter, email or text if something changes on your title deed (the record that shows you own your property). A change to your title deed can be the first warning sign of fraud, so it's important to keep your contact details updated. </p>

      <p>Use this service to check and update the contact details on your title deed.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
       Before you start
      </h2>

      <p>If there is a problem with your property, for example fraud, HM Land Registry will send a letter to the address on your title deed.</p>

      <p>If you donâ€™t live at this address, you can ask us to send a:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>letter to a different property</li>

     When you need to change your contact details

      <p>You must change the contact details on your title deed if you:</p>

        <li>move house</li>
        <li>change your email or phone number</li>
        <li>are a landlord (letters about your property should not go to your tenants)</li>

      HM Land Registry and online title deeds
      </h2>
      
       <p>Most property owners think that their conveyancer keeps their title deeds, but these are actually just copies. The  title deeds are now kept online by HM Land Registry. 

      <p>HM Land Registry keeps a record of everyone who owns a property (and their land). This record (your title deed) proves that you are the owner.</p>

      <p>If you own a house, flat or any other type of property, HM Land Registry has a record of your title deed. This includes your:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>name</li>
        <li>address (the one you own)
      </ul>

        How this service works
      </h2>
      
      <p> This service lets you check and update the contact details on your title deed.</p>
      
      <p>HM Land Registry recommends that you add an email or phone number to your title deed. These are the quickest way to contact you if there is a problem with your property.</p>

<p>You will:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>search for your property (by postcode or title number)</li>
        <li>confirm your address (or addresses, if you own more than 1 property)</li>
        <li>check your contact details</li>
        <li>update these details</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        Adding a postal address to your contact details will not change the address you own.
