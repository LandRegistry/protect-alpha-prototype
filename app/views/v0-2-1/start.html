      <p>HM Land Registry keeps a record of everyone who owns a property (and their land). This record (your title deed) proves that you own your land.</p>

      <p>If you own a house, flat or any other type of property, HM Land Registry has a record of your:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>name</li>
        <li>address (you own this property)</li>
        <li>address for correspondence (you live at this property)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        About this service
      </h2>

      <p>If there is a problem with your property, for example fraud, HM Land Registry will send a letter to the address you own.</p>

      <p>If you donâ€™t live at this address, you can ask us to send a:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>letter to a different property</li>
        <li>text</li>
        <li>email</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        How it works
      </h2>

      <p>You will search for the property you own (by postcode). We will show you the contact details we have for this property.</p>
      
      <p>These contact details should be the quickest way to contact you. You can add or change your:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>email</li>
        <li>phone number</li>
        <li>correspondence address</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          You cannot change your registered title address (property you own).

      <p>HM Land Registry recommends that you add an email or phone number. These are the quickest way to contact you if there is a problem with your property.</p>
